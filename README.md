This Unity 3D project is a simple runner-style game where the player controls a capsule that automatically moves forward on a track, avoids obstacles placed along the path, and collects coins to increase the score. The game demonstrates basic Unity concepts such as player movement, collision detection, simple physics interactions, and object collection, making it a great beginner-friendly project for learning core game development mechanics and scene setup in Unity.
